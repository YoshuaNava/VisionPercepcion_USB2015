Michael Sapienza, Kenneth P. Camilleri, A generative traversability model for monocular robot self-guidance,
9th Int. Conf. on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics, 2012. 

This software was developed by Michael Sapienza within the department of 'Systems & Control Engineering (SCE)' at the University of Malta under the supervision of Prof. Kenneth Camilleri.

What to do to run this software (tested on Ubuntu Linux 12.04LTS):
1) Install the OPENCV Library (2.4.8).
2) Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the code.
3) Type "make" to compile "ground_plane_segmentation".
4) To run type "./ground_plane_segmentation".
