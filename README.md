# Probabilistic Floor Segmentation

This repository stores a novel version of an algorithm to segment floor areas in grayscale and RGB images. Its long term purpose is to be part of a
future navigation system for a mobile robot.


Authors:
	Yoshua Nava and Rafael Colmenares

## How to compile the code:

**1)** Open a terminal and change directory to this repository root folder ("VisionPercepcion_USB2015/").

**2)** Type the following commands to compile everything:

```
./setup_everything_ws.sh
bash
```

## Instructions for running the algorithms:

**3)** To run the EGBIS superpixel segmentation test, type:

```./test_egbis_superpixel_segmentation ```

**4)** To run the SLIC superpixel segmentation test, type:

```./test_slic_superpixel_segmentation ```

**5)** To run the superpixel histogram comparison test, type:

```./test_histogram_superpixel_comparison ```


If you want to change the algorithm that is used for generating and comparing superpixels, change the value of the constant SUPERPIXEL_ALGORITHM (line 18) for either "EGBIS" or "SLIC"


## Dependencies:
Eigen, OpenCV 2.4+, cmake 2.8+, gcc, g++, and make.

gps_sapienza_ros: A ROS node that wraps the original GPS algorithm by Michael Sapienza.

libsuperpixels: A library for handling superpixels, that can be found in the folder usbgm_pfs/include/libsuperpixel.

slid_modified and egbis: Modified versions of the original SLIC and EGBIS libraries for superpixel segmentation, so that they can be compliant with libsuperpixel.

hough_horizon_search: A novel algorithm for identifying the floor using the structure of the scene.

gps_sapienza and gps_sapienza_encapsulated: Re-implementations of the original GPS algorithm by Michael Sapienza, introducing (1) Modern OpenCV methods, and (2) Genericity to image features generation and superpixels histogram comparison.

usbgm_pfs: A ROS packages that wraps all the aforementioned algorithms as libraries.

## TODO:

Make everything compliant with the ROS C++ Style Guide ( http://wiki.ros.org/CppStyleGuide )

Improve the performance of the SLIC algorithm, using intrinsics and Intel TBB.

Introduce a generic approach to superpixels comparison from different image features to Michael Sapienza algorithm, to merge it with hough_horizon_search and other feature generators.
